Unlike an if-else statement, blocks of code are not separated from each other and will keep executing block after block until told to stop
Using this, I haven't written anything for certain blocks of code to have them continue on to the next block.
I haven't written anything for some case either, and if a case isn't declared, no code will be executed by the switch statement.*/
